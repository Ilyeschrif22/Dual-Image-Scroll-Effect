# 🌌 Dual Image Scroll Effect

This project showcases a **dual image transition effect on scroll**.  
As the user scrolls, the **first image shrinks** while the **second image grows**, creating a smooth and dynamic transition.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The page contains two stacked images (`img1` and `img2`).  
2. When the user scrolls, JavaScript calculates the scroll progress.  
3. `img1` gradually shrinks while `img2` grows.  
4. This creates a **seamless scroll-based image transition** effect.
